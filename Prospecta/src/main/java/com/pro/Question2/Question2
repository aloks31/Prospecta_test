Theoretical Challenge
 
Suppose you have a CSV file with the data below.
 
A1: 5, A2: 7, A3: 9, B1: 3, B2: 8, B3: =4+5, C1: =5+A1, C2: =A2+B2, C3: =C2+B3
 
This can be represented in an excel sheet below:
 


 

   A    B    C

1  5    3    =5+A1

2  7    8    =A2+B2

3  9    =4+5    =C2+B3


 
I want a program that will take the CSV input above and produce CSV output with the results.  
If it is a value, then return a value.  
If it is a formula then calculate the formula and return the value of that formula.
 
 
 
Q1)  How will you tackle the challenge above?
Ans= 
 
     1 :  First,put this information inside csv.file in a single line using.
          
          BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("csv.file");
          
         
 
     2 :  Now, With the help of BufferedReader class object, I will read my data by using readLine() method.
 
          String data = bufferedReader.readLine();
          
 
     3 : after that convert string in Array of String using split method.
 
         String[] keys = data.split(",");
         
 
     4 : then, I will create a map and store it in the form of key-value pairs.
 
 
     5 : After that I will create One more Map for converting those strings values in the form of Integer value.
         With the help of running a loop on first map I will check that there is simple Integer value or any 
         function is there.
         If there will be any function then solve it and after that put the final Integer value for that key in
         the second map.
        
         
step 6 : And at the end, I will loop the map using entry and show the result in form of new key-value pairs.
           
           
         Map<String,String> map1 = new LinkedHashMap<>();
 		 
 		 Map<String,Integer> map1 = new LinkedHashMap<>();
 		 
 		 for(int i=0;i<key.length();i++){
 		 
 		      String[] str = keys[i].split(":");
 		      map.put(str[0].trim(),str[1].trim());
 		      
 		 }




Q2)  What type of errors you would you check for?
Ans= 
     1. check my string in proper format or not.
         
     2. In finding that it is normal Integer value of function of string which key here.
        I will use Regular Expressions to match it and finding if there will 
         be any Integer value without connected with any Character at the front of that.
         
     3. And we need to care about = , : and + signs as well.


Q3)  How might a user break your code?
Ans= User can break my code by doing some changes inside CSV file. Like if user will change 
     the format of input of input then this code will not work and if user will value of 
     numbers which more than the Max value of Integer then also it will not work properly.
